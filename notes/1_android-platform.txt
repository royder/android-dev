# Android Platform Overview
http://developer.android.com/training/index.html  
The android architecture is comprised of:  
* Linux Kernel
  * Drivers and Power Management
* Libraries and Runtime
  * Surface Manager, OpenGL, SGL, SSL, FreeType, Media Framework, SQLite, Webkit
* Application Framework
  * Activity Manager, Window Manager, Content Providers, Location Manager, etc
* Applications
  * Core apps that come with device (home/browser)

## Linux Kernel
Standard:  
* Security - Permissions
* Memory and Process Management
* File / Network IO
* Device Drivers

Android Specific:  
* Power Management
* Android Shared Memory
* Low Memory Killer
* Interprocess Communication (binder)

## Libraries 
* System C Lib - Bionic LIBC
* Surface Manager - Display Management
* Media Framework - A/V
* Webkit - rendering web pages
* OpenGL - high performance graphics
* SQLite - RDBS engine
* Android Runtime
  * Core Java Libraries - http://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html
    * Basic libraries -- JAVA.*, JAVAX.*
    * App Lifecycle -- ANDROID.*
    * Internet / Web Services -- ORG.*
    * Unit Testing -- JUNIT.*
  * Dalvik Virtual Machine - executes the android applications
    Usual Workflow:  
    Write application in Java  
    Compiled into bytecode  
    DX converts bytecode into DEX bytecode format CLASSES.DEX  
    Dalvik will execute the classes.dex file

## Application Framework Layer
reusable software to be used by apps  
  * Package Manager - keeps track of all applications installed
  * Window Manager - manages the windows
  * View System - icons, text entry, buttons, etc
  * Resource Manager - manages non-compiled reosurces that make up an app - strings graphics and layout files etc
  * Activity Manager - manages app lifecycle and navigation stack
  * Content Providers - DBs allowing apps to store and share info - inter-application data sharing
  * Location Manager - receive location and movement info - gps
  * Notification Manager - self descriptive

## Application Layer
Standard apps include home, contacts, phone, browser, email reader
